Summary:

1. Improved Code Readability and Structure
The code is well-structured with clear separation of functions.
Good use of logs to track execution flow and debugging.
Effective use of Firebase Authentication.
Suggestion: Extract the background setting logic into a separate function (`setBackgroundBasedOnTime()`) to improve readability.
Suggestion: Move the authentication check to a dedicated function (`handleUserAuthentication()`) to improve maintainability.

2. Code Modularity and Optimization
The function "checkAndCreateUser()" performs two distinct tasks:
1. Checking if the user exists in Firestore.
2. Creating a new user if they don’t exist.
  
Suggested Improvement: Separate this logic into two functions:
"checkIfUserExists()"
"createUserInFirestore()"

- Functions should have single responsibilities to enhance code maintainability.

3. Bug Prevention and Error Handling
Potential Crash Risk in "firebaseAuthWithGoogle()"
idToken is accessed without checking if it's null. This can lead to an application crash.
Suggested Fix: Add a safeguard before passing idToken to Firebase.

4. General Improvements
Improve function and variable naming for clarity:
Example: "toggleUserFromRoom" and "toggleRoomFromUser" should have more descriptive names.
Avoid generic variable names such as "flag", "data", and "list"—they lack context and reduce readability.
Modularize repetitive logic to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

Conclusion
The code is well-structured and makes good use of Firebase Authentication and logging. Implementing the suggested improvements will enhance readability, prevent potential crashes, and make the code more modular and maintainable.
